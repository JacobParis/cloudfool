## Food

### Roll the dice on lunch for sure. Lifeâ€™s short af.

I've spent my whole life sticking to foods I know, because why gamble on lunch?

But one day I had a sandwich so good it made me cry, and now I'm thinking I might have been playing this wrong. It was a prosciutto lettuce tomato sandwich from an italian bakery in Toronto. They called it a PLT. I didn't even go there for a sandwich. I was looking for their pre-made pizza dough, since I ate all of mine and didn't want to wait three days for pizza, and the sandwich was an afterthought.

The first bite stopped me in my tracks.

I had never eaten a sandwich that good. Somehow, I had managed to spend twenty five years without letting my tongue taste anything so good. Every time in my entire life that I had ordered the same things at the same restaurants became a memory of regret in an instant.

It broke my heart. My knees trembled. I sat on the sidewalk and cried while I ate it.

No one paid me much attention. The local pedestrians were used to stepping over crying men on Toronto sidewalks.

## Quotes

### The world forgives the honest grin, but the shifty eye opens no pathways

This quote came from a story I read during an exam in high school, and I never found it again.

The story is told from the perspective of a teacher supervising an exam, which felt rather meta at the time, but that's not important. He watched students work away at their papers in silence; he watched them try to cheat. One clueless student looks over at another clueless student, but he'll find no help there. The blind leading the blind.

Eventually, and with half the time left, a jock student gets up loudly and turns his paper in.

"I hope you did well, " says the teacher.
"Did well? Me? You've got to be kidding." the student laughs as he leaves.

"He'll do alright," thinks the professor. It was the other students who worried him. The ones stealing glances at each other's tests. The ones who snuck in slips of paper scrawled with notes. The world forgives the honest grin, but the shifty eye opens no pathways.

### When you lie to someone, even a white lie, you rob from them the chance to make their own moral decision based on the truth

Oddly enough (for a throwaway comment on someone else's facebook post by my second step-cousi[^1]), this one has been rattling around in my head for over ten years.

[^1]: Once removed.

Honesty without compassion may be brutality, but to allow others to be misled in the name of compassion is misguided at best.

### It's better to regret things you have done than haven't

Anyone who has met me will know I say this far more often than warranted. It's a catchphrase of sorts, and a particularly dangerous one at that.

I find it very easy to talk myself into almost anything.

Similar: "No one remembers the nights they got lots of sleep."
