## Quotes

### The world forgives the honest grin, but the shifty eye opens no pathways

This quote came from a story I read during an exam in high school, and I never found it again.

The story is told from the perspective of a teacher supervising an exam, which felt rather meta at the time, but that's not important. He watched students work away at their papers in silence; he watched them try to cheat. One clueless student looks over at another clueless student, but he'll find no help there. The blind leading the blind.

Eventually, and with half the time left, a jock student gets up loudly and turns his paper in.

"I hope you did well, " says the teacher.
"Did well? Me? You've got to be kidding." the student laughs as he leaves.

"He'll do alright," thinks the professor. It was the other students who worried him. The ones stealing glances at each other's tests. The ones who snuck in slips of paper scrawled with notes. The world forgives the honest grin, but the shifty eye opens no pathways.

### When you lie to someone, even a white lie, you rob from them the chance to make their own moral decision based on the truth

Oddly enough (for a throwaway comment on someone else's facebook post by my second step-cousin[1]), this one has been rattling around in my head for over ten years.

[1]: Once removed.

Honesty without compassion may be brutality, but to allow others to be misled in the name of compassion is misguided at best.

### It's better to regret things you have done than haven't

Anyone who has met me will know I say this far more often than warranted. It's a catchphrase of sorts, and a particularly dangerous one at that.

I find it very easy to talk myself into almost anything.

Similar: "No one remembers the nights they got lots of sleep."
