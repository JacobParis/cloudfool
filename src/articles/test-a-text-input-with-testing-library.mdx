These examples are built with the following opinion:

- The simplified queries from [rtl-simple-queries](https://github.com/balavishnuvj/rtl-simple-queries) are installed

## A textbox has the correct value

If a textbox has been updated by user interaction, we can test its value directly.

<TestTextInput class="mb-10">

```js numbered labeled
const usernameInput = screen.fetchByRole('textbox', {
  name: 'Username',
})

expect(usernameInput).toHaveValue('Alice')
```

</TestTextInput>

## An input has the correct value after being updated externally

<TestTextInputAsync>

If a textbox has been updated by an outside source, such as an API or another component, we can't guarantee that will happen immediately. In these cases, use the `async` queries.

```js numbered labeled
const usernameInput = await screen.fetchByRoleAsync('textbox', {
  name: 'Username',
})

expect(usernameInput).toHaveValue('Alice')
```

</TestTextInputAsync>
